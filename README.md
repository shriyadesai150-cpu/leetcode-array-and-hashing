# leetcode-array-and-hashing

Welcome to Cornell FinTech Club’s NME LeetCode practice repo!

In this repo, we’ll walk through essential coding interview problems to build your data structures & algorithm fundamentals — starting with the most foundational topic:

Topic 1: Arrays & Hashing

We’ll cover beginner-friendly LeetCode problems such as:
	•	Contains Duplicate
	•	Two Sum
	•	Valid Anagram
	•	Group Anagrams

Each problem includes:
	•	A clean function skeleton
	•	Sample test cases
	•	Both Python and Java implementations

How to Run the Code

Python

1.	Make sure Python is installed:

    python --version

2.	Open any .py file (e.g. solution.py) and run:

    python solution.py



⸻

Java

Each Java file is organized in a folder that matches its package name (e.g. contains_duplicates/Solution.java).

1. Navigate to the parent directory of the package:

cd path/to/project

2. Compile the file:

javac package_name/Solution.java

3. Run the file:

java package_name.Solution

Example:

javac contains_duplicates/Solution.java
java contains_duplicates.Solution

	•	Sliding window
	•	Stack/Queue
	•	Binary Search
	•	Graphs
	•	Recursion & Backtracking
